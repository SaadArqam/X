# 🧠 Smart Blog Platform (AI-Assisted)

## 1. Project Overview

The Smart Blog Platform is a full-stack AI-assisted blogging system built using TypeScript end-to-end. 

Unlike traditional blogging platforms, this system enhances content creation using AI-driven features such as:

- AI writing assistance
- Automatic summaries (TL;DR)
- Smart tag recommendations
- SEO and readability analysis

The goal is to create a production-ready blogging platform that combines strong backend architecture with modern frontend UX and AI integration.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many blogging platforms allow users to write and publish content but do not actively assist them in:

- Improving readability
- Structuring content properly
- Optimizing for SEO
- Generating summaries
- Suggesting relevant tags

This project solves that problem by embedding AI tools directly inside the writing workflow.
